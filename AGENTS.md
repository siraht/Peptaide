# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANSwHD.md) from design to implementation.

# How to operate

After beginning work, do not prompt the user for "next steps"; simply proceed according to the ExecPlan and the instructions for it's use in PLANSwHD.md. Resolve ambiguities autonomously, and commit frequently. You are in charge of the success of the project.
