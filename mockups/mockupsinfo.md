The "Power User Log & Analytics Dashboard" has been updated with your new layout requirements:

    Enhanced Log Grid: The logging area now features inline recommendation hints for dosage ranges that appear as soon as a substance is selected, helping you stay within your configured parameters.
    Scrollable Analytics Container: Located beneath the log, this area now hosts modular widgets for deep data dives, including Monte Carlo uncertainty ribbons, daily dose comparisons, and spend burn-rate tracking.
    Substance Control Sidebar: The right sidebar has been unified into a comprehensive "Substance Control Center" where each substance card displays its active inventory, cycle progress (e.g., "Day 12 of 30"), break duration, and cost metrics simultaneously.

Would you like to dive deeper into the "Cycle Automation" logic or perhaps design the interface for adding new recommendations and distributions?

The Master Data & Config Editor has been designed to serve as a unified command center for all your structural data:

    Unified Navigation: A left sidebar provides instant access to all ten categories (Substances, Routes, Cycles, etc.), ensuring you don't have to navigate through multiple nested menus.
    Universal Grid Component: Every tab utilizes the same spreadsheet-style "Master Grid," enabling keyboard-first bulk editing and consistent interaction patterns across different data types.
    Contextual Side Panel: Selecting any row in the grid opens a right-side panel specifically for the Recommendations & Distributions Editor. Here, you can adjust Monte Carlo parameters (min/mode/max) and link evidence sources (DOI/URLs) without losing your place in the main list.
    Reusable Evidence & Analytics: The design ensures that whether you are adding a distribution for a Substance or a Formulation, the interface for evidence tracking remains identical, reducing cognitive load.

This setup makes the app "extensible by construction," allowing you to manage complex relationships like linking a "Vial" to an "Order" or a "Route" to a "Distribution" with minimal clicks.

Would you like to see a specific example of the "Orders to Vials" generation flow within this editor, or perhaps the "Evidence Link" detailed view?
